# This file uses the version 3 docker-compose file format, described here:
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#version-3
#
# This runs Zipkin (server, MySQL DB and dependency), Telegraf and 
# InfluxDB attached to Telegraf, using docker-compose default networking
# to connect the containers.
#
# This is simplistic but is intended to allow the Apollo energy monitoring
# environment dependencies to be started quickly as Docker containers on a
# single host.
#
# It is heavily based on the Ziplin example from 
# https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
